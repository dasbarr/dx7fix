# DX7 Fix

Tiny proxy dll that fixes graphics glitches for DirectX7 games "Sacred" and "Dungeon Siege". Maybe it can fix similar issues with other DirectX7 games.


# Usage

Place proxy lib file (ddraw.dll) into the folder that contains game executable file (for example, **/Steam/steamapps/common/Sacred Gold/** or **/Steam/steamapps/common/Dungeon Siege 1**). Run the game.
***
Note: if you are using this fix with Sacred and glitches still occur, try to change various settings in Config.exe in the game folder.
